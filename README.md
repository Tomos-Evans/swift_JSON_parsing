# Parsing JSON to CustomDatatypes in Swift 3

## Motivation
On your quest to develop your perfect iOS app, it will soon become apparent that there is only so much you can do with good UX. It is at this point that the three golden letters on convienient and usefull information will cross your path, API. APIs are used to provide extra data and information, whih comre almost exclusivly in JSON format, which is the center of this centre of this project.

This tutorial will discuss methods and implement a way of asynchronously parsing JSON that was returned from an API call into custom datatypes for further use in your app. The project will be based around the [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/), and create a small project that displays information about any specified movie. Although the project is simple, the techniques are highly scalable, and common place in large software development projects. 

### What is JSON?
JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), is a human readable format for structuring data. It is used primarily to transmit data between a server and web application. The main structure behind JSON is **key-value** pairs. These pairs are simular to a dictionary in Java or Python, and consist of a **key**, which is the identifier, and a **value** which is the data that will be returned when the corresdponding value is requested.
